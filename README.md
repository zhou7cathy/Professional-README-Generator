# Professional-README-Generator

## Description
This command-line application is created for users to be able to create a professional README for a new project in a fast way.

## Installation
Inquirer version 8.2.4

## Usage
When you invoked the application in terminal/bash by node index.js you will prompted for information about your application. Then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of your project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. 

When you choose a license for your application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under. 

When you enter your GitHub username and email address, this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions for users to reach you with additional questions. When you click on the links in the Table of Content, you are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
